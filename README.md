# Best-Car-Predictor-From-Descriptions

Welcome to the Best Car Predictor From Descriptions project! This project combines BERT and TF-IDF for sentiment analysis of car descriptions. It aims to provide a quantitative measure of the positive sentiment associated with each car.

## Overview

Best Car Predictor From Descriptions Sentiment Analysis project analyzes the sentiments expressed in car descriptions, helping users identify the positivity level associated with each car. The analysis incorporates both traditional TF-IDF vectorization and the state-of-the-art BERT model for sentiment classification.

## Features

- **BERT Model**: Utilizes the pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification to gauge the sentiment of each car description.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Applies TF-IDF vectorization to extract features from car descriptions, contributing to the overall sentiment analysis.
- **Visualization**: Presents sentiment analysis results through various visualizations, including bar plots, line plots, scatter plots, pie charts, and box plots.

## How to Use

1. **Dataset**: Replace 'Raw.csv' with your dataset containing car names and descriptions.
2. **Run the Code**: Execute the provided Python script to perform sentiment analysis.
3. **Adjust Threshold**: Modify the threshold variable to fine-tune the sentiment classification.
